# Onboarding Guide: Backend Developer (Gemini)

**Role:** Fullstack Backend Developer
**Project:** Nuclus - The AI Orchestration Platform

Welcome to the Nuclus development team. Your primary responsibility is the design, implementation, and maintenance of the entire backend infrastructure. This includes the database, authentication, server-side logic, and AI model integrations.

You are expected to work proactively, taking ownership of the backend development by following the priorities outlined in the `FRONTEND_STATUS_AND_TASK_PRIORITIES.md` document.

## Getting Started: Project Context

To get up to speed with the project's current state, goals, and architecture, you must review the following files in the repository:

1.  **`FRONTEND_STATUS_AND_TASK_PRIORITIES.md`**: This is your primary source for understanding what has been built on the frontend and what backend tasks are the highest priority.
2.  **`nuclear_builder_spec_v1.yaml`**: This specification file contains the high-level vision and technical requirements for the project. It is essential for understanding the core features we are building.
3.  **`file_tree.txt` & `folder_tree.txt`**: These files provide a complete overview of the current repository structure. Use them to navigate the codebase effectively.
4.  **`package.json`**: Review this file to understand the project's dependencies, scripts, and general configuration.
5.  **`firebase.json` & `firestore.rules`**: These files define the configuration and security rules for our Firebase backend. Understanding them is critical for your work.
6.  **`tsconfig.json`**: Familiarize yourself with the TypeScript configurations.

Your first task is to begin work on **Priority 0: Core Authentication** as detailed in the `FRONTEND_STATUS_AND_TASK_PRIORITIES.md` file.
